          <h2 class="page__subtitle">Adding/Dropping a Product Line or Segment</h2>
          <p>The general rule is that if the contribution margin lost is larger than the fixed cost loss and contribution margin gain, <strong>keep the segment</strong>:</p>
          <div class="code code__block">
            <em>Keep if:</em> CM Lost > Fixed Expenses Avoided + CM Gain
          </div>
          <p>There are two possible approaches: the <strong>contribution</strong> approach, and the <strong>income</strong> approach.</p>
          <h3 class="page__subtitle">Contribution Approach</h3>
          <p>The contribution approach only looks at all the factors that <strong>change</strong>.</p>
          <p>The segment should only be dropped only if its profits would increase afterwards. That is, only keep the segment if the total fixed cost avoidable exceeds the lost contribution margin.</p>
          <h3 class="page__subtitle">Comparative Income</h3>
          <p>The comparative income approach prepares two income statements before and after the decision to drop the segment (assuming this decision is pushed forward).</p>
          <h3 class="page__subtitle">Beware of Allocated Common Costs</h3>
          <p>Allocated common costs may make a segment look unprofitable even though dropping it may result in an increase in the overall company net income.</p>
          <p class="page__quote">Allocated common costs that would not be affected by a decision are irrelevant and should be ignored.</p>

          <h2 class="page__subtitle">The Make or Buy Decision</h2>
          <p>A decision to carry out one of the activities in the value chain internally rather than to buy from a supplier is called a <strong>make or buy</strong> decision.</p>
          <p><strong>Make</strong> Advantages:</p>
          <ul class="page__list">
            <li>Smoother flow of parts and materials for production.</li>
            <li>Better quality control.</li>
            <li>Profits realized from the parts & materials that they make instead of buy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Buy</strong> Advantages:</p>
          <ul class="page__list">
            <li>Economies of scale of the suppliers.</li>
            <li>Specialized suppliers may be able to respond more quickly and at less cost to changing needs.</li>
            <li>Changing technology may make producing one's own parts riskier than purchasing from the outside.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To make a decision, we <strong>only</strong> look at costs. We choose to make only if:</p>
          <br />
          <div class="code code__block">
            Avoidable Cost To Make < Avoidable Cost To Buy

          <h2 class="page__subtitle">Opportunity Costs</h2>
          <p>An opportunity cost is the benefit foregone as a result of pursuing some other course of action.</p>
          <p>Opportunity costs should be considered when making decisions. The telltale sign of an opportunity cost is when you have <strong>scarce resources</strong> or a <strong>constraint</strong>.</p>
          <p class="page__quote">When there is excess capacity there is <em>no</em> opportunity cost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page__content">
          <h2 class="page__subtitle">Special Orders</h2>
          <p>A <strong>special-order</strong> is a one-time order that is not considered part of the company's normal ongoing business. The decision rule is:</p>
          <div class="code code__block">
            <em>Accept if:</em> Incremental Revenue > Incremental Costs
          </div>
          <p>If the special order requires a constrained resource, <strong>opportunity costs</strong> should be included as part of the incremental costs.</p>
          <p>If a <strong>partial order</strong> may be accepted, then there would be no opportunity costs (even if there is a constrained resource).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page__content">
          <h3 class="page__subtitle">Example: Special Order</h3>
          <p>Jet Inc. makes a single product whose normal selling price is $20 per unit. A foreign distributor is offering a one-time order of 3,000 units, for $10 per unit. Annual capacity is 10,000 units, but Jet Inc. is currently producing and selling only 5,000 units.</p>

          <h2 class="page__subtitle">Utilization of a Constrained Resource</h2>
          <p>When a limited resource of some type restricts the company's ability to satisfy demand, the company is said to have a constraint. To optimize the constraint, <strong>prioritize based on contribution margin per scarce resource</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
          <p>A furniture company only has 2,000 board feet this month. Data for the company is as follows:</p>
          <table class="code">
            <tr>
